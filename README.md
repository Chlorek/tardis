# Tardis
## Introduction
C++ library for generating complex worlds height-maps. Just like Dr. Who's Tardis, this Tardis will take you to countless places too!

The generator is based on simple noise generator wrapped in simple yet powerful modern API.
This program originally started as my scholarship project, formely *Little Bang". The whole concept is still the same, but it was rewritten
to make it modular and extend its possibilities by allowing end user to use internal, basic functions, but without stripping ready-to-use features
as well, these are built on top of those basic functions. Everything is object-oriented so you can extend functionality to fit your wild needs.

Keep in mind it's not just noise generator like perlin noise (however basic output pretty much resembles it). Tardis lets you design
complicated height-maps, with enough tinkering there is possibility to achieved *(I hope)* pretty much anything you want.
